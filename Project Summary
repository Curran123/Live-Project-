#Live Project Summary

####I have included examples of code that I worked on over the course of a two-week sprint, in which an task from a client was simulated.
####We were to make numerous changes to a theatre company's website per their exact specifications. My own work was entirely front-end,
####and in that time, I completed three key tasks.



######The first task saw me make several changes to the login page, including adjusting the input fields for the email and password,
######which was accomplish through a handful of simple classes on the CSS page:

######/*This class was added to move most of the content of the login page to the left*/ 
.loginpadding {
    padding-left: 50px;
}

######/*This class was also added to move certain elements on the login page left*/
.loginhtwo{
    padding-left: 65px;
    padding-top: 50px;
}
######/*This class was added to move the login button more to the right*/
.loginhthree{
    padding-right: 45px;
    padding-left: 5px;
}


They were in turn implemented on the login page itself, along with bootstrap grids to accomodate a variety of screen sizes:




######In the third and final task, I created a CSS selector in order to resolve a priority conflict between a class and an ID which had prevented me 
######from change the font color of the navigation bar's drop-down menus. 

####### #navbarSupportedContent .color {
    color: #212529
}

#######It was subsequently applied to the layout page:

#######<!--Events-->
                <li class="nav-item dropdown">
                    <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle color" href="#" id="navbarDropdownMenuLink" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
                        Events
                    </a>
                    
######<!--Company-->
                <li class="nav-item dropdown">
                    <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle color" href="#" id="navbarDropdownMenuLink" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
                        Company
                    </a>
                    
######<!--Admin-->
                <li class="nav-item dropdown">
                    <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle color" href="" id="navbarDropdownMenuLink" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
                        Admin
                    </a>
                    
######<!--Subscriber-->
                <li class="nav-item dropdown">
                    <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle color" href="#" id="navbarDropdownMenuLink" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
                        Subscriber
                    </a>
                    
                    
######The second part of the task was to adjust the speed at which the navigation bar and logo expanded and shrank when scrolling,
######which was resolved with the following change on the CSS page:
###### #menu {
            transition: 0.8s;
            padding: 20px;
        }

        #logo {
            transition: 0.8s;
        }
